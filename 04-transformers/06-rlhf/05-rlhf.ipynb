This had surprising results - when surveyed, most people prefered the responses of the GPT-2 assistant model over the responses of GPT-3, despite the assistant model having more than 100x fewer parameters.\n","\n","The introduction of the instruct series of GPT models is arguably what led to the wave of mainstream AI adoption we're in today - ChatGPT was released with the InstructGPT-3 model and the obvious practicaly assistant format made the tool immediately catch on.\n","\n","The success of InstructGPT was an initial indication of the effect and leverage of good fine-tuning with specific taste - despite all previous language models also using the pre-training and fine-tuning pattern, the fine-tune of InstructGPT was clearly far preferable to anything tried in the past.\n","\n","### Approach\n","\n","The fine-tuning approach taken by InstructGPT had 3 important steps.\n","\n","First, they started by creating a human generate dataset of good output behaviors for an assistant model. These are pairs of questions a human might ask to the model along with an ideal response written by a human labeler. Given the nature of how big of an impact this dataset would have on the model, the human labelers were also carefully vetted by OpenAI.\n","\n","They used this dataset to fine-tune the GPT model after pre-training, makings its responses initially resemble an assistant.\n","\n","Next, they collect comparisons of different outputs to the same prompts that are generated by the actual model. These comparison are then labeled by humans who select the preferable response.\n","\n","This creates a comparison dataset which is used to train a reward model that can predict outputs that humans would prefer.\n","\n","Finally, this reward model can be used as a function to maximize the reward for proximal policy optimization (PPO).\n","\n","This combination of data collection from manually created human datasets and some jointly created data (synthetic data from the model, along with human labels to inject preferences) compose a robust RLHF process that produces far more preferable responses.\n","\n","This RLHF is now happening at scale with modern language models which occasionally present comparisons to users, collecting a massive crowd-sourced dataset for fine-tuning.\n","\n","### Further Reading\n","\n","Below, I've included my notes for the InstructGPT paper. Given that many of the interesting RLHF papers build on each other or discuss relatively intuitive concepts (aside from PPO, which has a bit more complexity), I haven't taken notes on them - but for anyone curious to read more I'd recommend the following papers:\n","\n","- [Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08593)\n","- [Training a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862)\n","- [Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7_Abq2DHJakT"},"source":["# My Notes\n","\n","## 📜 [Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155)\n","\n","> Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user’s intent.\n","\n","> In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback.\n","\n","> In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters.
